          <h1>IT ALL STARTED FROM A SMALL DINER...</h1><br><br>
          <p class="text-justify">Since he was a young boy, Takumi's current owner, Yukihira Soma, aspired to become a full-time chef in the family restaurant of his father, Joichiro, called "Takumi Diner" and also wanted to surpass his father's culinary skills. However, his father got a new job that requires him to travel around the world and closes his shop. Joichiro enrolled Soma in Totsuki Saryo Culinary Institute, an elite culinary school where students engage in food competitions called shokugeki. He secures himself a spot at the school, meets other young aspiring chefs, and challenged Totsuki's students as well as others in shokugeki competitions. Learning that his father was not only a student of Totsuki, but also had the second seat in the top students of the academy, Soma aimed to  become the best at the academy.</p><br>
          <p class="text-justify">His school life proved very challenging, as he entered numerous competitions non-stop not only to prove his excellence his cooking, but to also learn from his various opponents. Dropping out of Totsuki was common, but it never was a threat to Yukihira Soma. That said, to pursue to reach the top of the culinary industry, Yukihira Soma stopped after his second year in Totsuki. His unbeatable talent got him to compete in world-class shokugeki competitions. Here, not only did he meet, compete, and learned from the best chefs alive, he also gained a lot of worldwide fame as he travelled across the world. </p><br>
          <p class="text-justify">In his journey through the world of culinary, he has gotten to the point where he had beaten his own father, Joichiro, and proved himself worthy to own the family business, Takumi.</p>
